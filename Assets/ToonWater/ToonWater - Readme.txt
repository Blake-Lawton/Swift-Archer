INSTRUCTIONS

Use one of the prefabs as a starting point.
The water can automatically add ToonWaterFloatObject script to every object that falls into it. (Beach Ball)
For better control over the floating object, attach this script to each object that should float on the water. (Rubber Duck)
Disable autoAddFloat if it is not needed.
